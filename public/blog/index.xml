      <description>Writing documentation makes you shed all the fluff.&#xA;Any words unnecessary to a description, any words unnecessary to make you understood.&#xA;You delete.&#xA;I like this writing style, it’s pragmatic, it’s very in line with coding, simple is better.&#xA;But I also aspire to write fiction, which requires the fluff (I think).&#xA;I’m spending my days writing in a way that can’t be used for my other projects.&#xA;It’s hard to reconcile, sometimes.</description>

Any words unnecessary to a description, any words unnecessary to make you understood.<br>
You delete.</p>
<p>I like this writing style, it’s pragmatic, it’s very in line with coding, simple is better.<br>
But I also aspire to write fiction, which requires the fluff (I think).</p>
<p>I’m spending my days writing in a way that can’t be used for my other projects.<br>
It’s hard to reconcile, sometimes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After almost two years of contract work.<br>
This is the first time that I have said no to work.</p>
<p>The first client I am okay not building a relationship with.<br>
There’s nothing inherently wrong with what was proposed nor the interaction we had.</p>
<p>I’ve delivered a first project.<br>
There was a lot of work ahead, a promise of a regular income and a long term client.</p>
<p>Clients like them I usually sought. Their stability reassuring me while I kept whatever freedom this is.<br>
This time it felt a bit different. I saw myself finishing the first contract, marking a pause, not rushing to the next.</p>
<p>Trusted my gut and said “I won’t continue”.<br>
The yes man of the rat race died that day.</p>
<p>Odd and liberating.</p>
