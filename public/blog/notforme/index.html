  <p>After almost two years of contract work.<br>
This is the first time that I have said no to work.</p>
<p>The first client I am okay not building a relationship with.<br>
There’s nothing inherently wrong with what was proposed nor the interaction we had.</p>
<p>I’ve delivered a first project.<br>
There was a lot of work ahead, a promise of a regular income and a long term client.</p>
<p>Clients like them I usually sought. Their stability reassuring me while I kept whatever freedom this is.<br>
This time it felt a bit different. I saw myself finishing the first contract, marking a pause, not rushing to the next.</p>
<p>Trusted my gut and said “I won’t continue”.<br>
The yes man of the rat race died that day.</p>
<p>Odd and liberating.</p>
