Writing documentation makes you shed all the fluff.
Any words unnecessary to a description, any words unnecessary to make you understood.
You delete.

I like this writing style, it’s pragmatic, it’s very in line with coding, simple is better.
But I also aspire to write fiction, which requires the fluff (I think).

I’m spending my days writing in a way that can’t be used for my other projects. 
It’s hard to reconcile, sometimes.
