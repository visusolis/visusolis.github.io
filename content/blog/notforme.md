After almost two years of contract work.
This is the first time that I have said no to work.

The first client I am okay not building a relationship with.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with what was proposed nor the interaction we had.

I’ve delivered a first project.
There was a lot of work ahead, a promise of a regular income and a long term client.

Clients like them I usually sought. Their stability reassuring me while I kept whatever freedom this is. 
This time it felt a bit different. I saw myself finishing the first contract, marking a pause, not rushing to the next.

Trusted my gut and said “I won’t continue”.
The yes man of the rat race died that day.

Odd and liberating.
